I am a software developer with a core belief: technology's greatest value is unlocked when it's applied to solve real-world, complex problems. My career is built on a foundation of Python, security principles, and automation, but my passion extends to the intersection of disciplines.

My professional journey is guided by two questions: "How can this system be made more efficient and secure?" and "How can this knowledge be structured to empower others?"

This approach has led me to work on a diverse range of projects:

* **As a Technologist,** I build secure software, design automation workflows, and explore the applications of AI. You can see this work in my **[Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/)**.

* **As a Researcher,** I delve into non-technical domains, from creative writing to health theory, which you can find on my **[Explorations site]({{ site.baseurl }}/personal/)**.

* **As a Volunteer,** I dedicate my time to creating a structured knowledge base for animal care, a project driven by a mission to make vital information accessible. This is my **[Animal Care Initiative]({{ site.baseurl }}/animal-care/)**.

I believe the future is built by professionals who can operate across boundaries. If you share this vision or are interested in my work, feel free to get in touch.
